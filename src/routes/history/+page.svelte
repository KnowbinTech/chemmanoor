						The Chemmanur family traces its roots back to the early 1600s in the lush landscapes of
						Kerala. Originally hailing from Perakam, the family has a storied history that
						intertwines with the local culture and traditions of the region. The family name, 'Chemmanur,'
						is believed to be derived from the Malayalam words for 'red soil,' reflecting the rich, fertile
						lands of their ancestral home.

					In the late 1600s, a significant event led to the migration of part of the family to
					Tirur. This move was catalyzed by an invitation from the local temple authorities to take
					over certain religious responsibilities, a testament to the family's esteemed position
					within the community. As a reward for their service, the family was granted land, marking
					the beginning of a new chapter in Tirur.
